## Challenge 2

There are responses or subreddits to everything.

## Challenge 3

You can figure out which responses/subreddits are most liked based on the number of subreddits.

## Challenge 4

What is on the minds of the Reddit Community.

## Challenge 5

I couldn't get this to work.

## Challenge 6

It really just depends on what was liked. There could be something very important that wasn't liked and yet something else got more publicity because it was liked more.

## Challenge 7

Broaden our data, and maybe look more into the likes vs relativity of something.

## Challenge 8

Our data is pretty restricted time-wise and location-wise. 

## Challenge 9

I would add more locations to the data so we can really see what more people are thinking.

## Challenge 10

Well the events on the date are significant, so that would definitely show what most of what the Reddit Community is thinking.
